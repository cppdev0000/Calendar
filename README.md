# Calendar component

![calendar](/assets/calendar.png)

This is a basic Angular calendar component. It does not use any newer features such as flexbox or grid, just a regular table. The main difference between this calendar and other Angular based calendars is that it is designed to scroll week by week rather than a month at a time. This lets you see events or other calendar items across months.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.1.

## Running the demo
